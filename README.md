# Word-Guess-Game

This game is similar to hangman, themed to Super Mario Bros. Use the keyboard to type letters. If your letter is correct, it will display in the word. If your guess is incorrect, it will display in Letters Already Guessed. If you get all the letters in the word you win and the game resets. If you make 10 incorrect guesses, you lose and the game is over and will reset. You win total is tallied at the bottom.
